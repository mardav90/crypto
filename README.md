## Week 2 Homework Activity (See Moodle for all Homework)

Add a link below to a learning resource that's helped you so far and say why you're linking it. Resources must be unique so the faster you are the easier it'll be for you.

e.g.

[PyMOTW](https://pymotw.com/3/) - Python Module Of The Week. A list of built-in Python modules and how to use them. Maybe be a bit advanced for some students right now (week 2) but you'll find it useful by the time you finish the semester. - Kris

Loni Kerrigan
[Codecademy] (https://www.codecademy.com) - I used this website 3 years ago to introduce myself to Python. It had some cool exercises that walk you through everything step by step. It feels like playing a game. I definitely recommend it.

Alice Deng
1. https://developers.google.com/edu/python - I found this link very good, it cover a basic python language, and also there have some very goood example on it  
2. https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm - Another good site like w3schools.com which give you very good Python Tutorial for you to understand.
 
 Ruslan Mustaev 
1. https://www.python.org/ - official website of the Python project.
2. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008  - This link refers to the PEP(Python Enhancement Proposals). It is very important to read to make very good consistent code and following coding standards.
3. https://realpython.com/ - good and well described Python courses and tutorials. 

[Nik Ledogorov: LinkedIn - Advance Your Skills In Python](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/advance-your-skills-in-python) - this is only 1 month free trial but is decent.

Kevin: https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp Python Tutorial  (not just about Python but many other langranges as well)

[Kirill: Offical Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) - Found this as a good overview of Python and useful reference when coding.

[David D: LinkedIn - Learning Cryptography and Network Security](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-cryptography-and-network-security) - doing this at the moment to support my cryptography studies. Very good as an overview to get a head start on what we can expect in this course for those of us that like a flipped classroom. :)

Jag: somethings that helped me when I was doing my computer science degree at University of Auckland.
[Jag: Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - beest interactive way to learn python and caters for all levels.
[Jag's GDrive link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qfa7k-2rxZ_Or80MykGOhMaCU_rFfGO3?usp=sharing) - this drive has all the basics of python and honestly if you binge watch them like we all do for netflix you will ace python this saved me in my degree.

[Nick Castle: ScratchPad](https://scratchpad.co.nz/product/develop-websites-using-python/) - This is a private company inside New Zealand which you can go to their classes if you need to attend classes in person. One of their closest office is at Mount Albert.

Mark David: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-python-from-zero-to-hero-120ea540b567/ - I liked how this guy wrote this guide, as a guy that prefers to read and then try it rather than watching it, I found it very useful.

Sarah Abbas: For beginners like me, I found a book called COMPUTER CODING FOR KIDS BY CAROL VORDERMAN very useful to me as it is simple and easy.

Narendra Inti : I found the socraticia YouTube videos very useful as I had no prior programming experience.

Lona Mafaufau
1. [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/python-fundamentals) has 'learning tracks' with an in-built editor and small coding challenges and really fast feedback.
2. [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) lets you practice online, and I like that each challenge has tutorials/editorials to compare your solution.
3. [Mike & Matty](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLh_4sKYaH6Jy7qFzY4y51xpIovksMTNup)'s YouTube channel introduced me to some cool learning techniques which I'm trying out at the moment based on active recall, spaced repetition, and Zettelkasten method. They created an app called [Remnote](https://www.remnote.io/) which I'm also trialling. 

Mohammad Shahid Siddiqui
I Started with the basic book : Byte of Python (Swaroop)
https://python.swaroopch.com/
Now reading and learning with tuples and dictionaries.
I spent time playing with Cryptography package:
https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/
I also installed gmpy2 to play with large prime numbers, finding next prime after a very big large num.
https://pypi.org/project/gmpy2/


Lavinia Tuitahi:
I've used freecodecamp in the past for web development and now use it again for Python learning and just repetition of basic concepts. https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/
Also a good resource https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp which lets you try out code on browser


Qiao Chu
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/learning-python-from-zero-hero-tk-
It explaints basic Python functions in plain words with examples. Very friendly to beginners

JASON SAM--

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python. one of the best sites to ask legit questions about anyting that has to do with any programming language. the great thing about this site is that it actual peers answering the questions. the catch is that you cant just go in there and ask for answers to problems that you havent attempted, they will call you out on it.\

https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/  just like Visual Studio, this IDE is great for pyhton programming projects.
https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/examples Great tutorials

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8  -Python Tutorial for Beginners [Quick & Easy]

Denise Carter-Bennett:
A lot of what I have used for learning Python has already been listed: Datacamp, JetBrains, etc.
One other tool I use to learn Python is the Mimo app (available through iOS and Android) - I find this app really handy to reinforce the basics and something I can do on the bus.

Week 7 

Mark David: Five job titles and positions that I'm interested in pursuing
